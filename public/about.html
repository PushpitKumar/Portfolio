<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, My name is Pushpit. Welcome to my Website! I am a Back-end Application Developer working at Cognizant for about a year now. I wanted to create a create a Portfolio website to showcase my projects as I have just started to delve deep into Web Developement.
</p>

<p>
  I have been interested in the IT field since my highschool days when i first started coding in C++. Some of the first projects I made were a Tic-Tac-Toe game and a Hotel Mangement System. I have been trained on the .NET framework and have been using C# as my primary language since joining cognizant. I also have a keen interest in AI & ML for which I have done some basic projects like Flight Price Prediction and Bank Note Classification.
</p>

<p>I got into Web Developement during my internship with Cognizant, where I was trained on MVC framework, using which I developed a Todo List Web-App. This was a significant milestone as I want to make this application look more beautiful once i gain the required front-end skills which I am curretnly mastering. So, I hope you enjoy some of the projects I have showcased on my website.
