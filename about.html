<p class="type-it" data-text="Hi, My name is Pushpit. I am currently pursuing an <strong>MSc in Data Science</strong> at the <strong>University of Exeter</strong>. Previously, I worked as an <strong>Application Developer</strong> at Cognizant (March 2023 – July 2025), where I primarily contributed to projects built on the <strong>.NET Framework</strong> with C#, and implemented back-end logic using SQL Server Stored Procedures. Notably, I developed a <strong>Batch Job</strong> to extract employee resumes—initially from ECM (Enterprise Content Management System) and later from OCM (Oracle Content Management System)—and securely transfer them to an SFTP location. I also created an <strong>ASP.NET Web API</strong> to serve skill details to internal applications and developed a <strong>WCF service</strong> to support bulk data retrieval. My work extended to UI enhancements, implementing new features, performing <strong>security fixes (CAST, SAST, DAST, OSS & MASA)</strong>, and overhauling backend systems. One of my recent projects included building an <strong>ASP.NET Core Web API</strong> that returned skill details in <strong>Adaptive Card JSON</strong> format for rendering in MS Teams. Additionally, I also contributed towards the development of a <strong>chatbot</strong> powered by <strong>Azure OpenAI</strong> to summarize and categorize documents indexed in <strong>Azure Cognitive Search</strong>. I have also completed a 1-month remote internship as a <strong>Python Developer</strong> with <strong>Brainnest</strong>."></p>

<p class="type-it" data-text="My interest in the IT field dates back to my high school days when I began coding in <strong>C++</strong>. Some of my earliest projects included a <strong>Tic-Tac-Toe game</strong> and a <strong>Hotel Management System</strong> for my final year project. During this time, I also delved into <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>DBMS</strong> concepts, which allowed me to handle data-related tasks using DDL, DML, and DCL statements in MySQL. Achieving 90% in Computer Science during my 12<sup>th</sup> boards further solidified my passion for the subject. My undergraduate years in Civil Engineering (2017-2021) at <strong>Manipal Institute of Technology</strong> were intellectually stimulating, equipping me with analytical skills to tackle real-world challenges beyond classroom theory. Collaborating with peers from diverse backgrounds and regions exposed me to a spectrum of perspectives. Access to free Coursera licenses from our college marked the beginning of my journey into Data Science. During the winter break of 2019, I enrolled in the course <i>'What is Data Science'</i> as part of the <strong>IBM Data Science Professional Certificate</strong> on Coursera. Building on my SQL experience, I completed courses covering machine learning, Python programming, data manipulation using pandas, and solving linear and classification problems. Seeking a deeper understanding beyond online courses, I explored mathematical foundations of ML algorithms and essential statistical concepts through articles on <strong>Medium</strong>, <strong>Kaggle</strong>, and educational YouTube videos. To apply theoretical knowledge practically, I embarked on end-to-end ML projects. Starting with foundational datasets like the Titanic and House Price Prediction on Kaggle, I progressed to independent projects such as <strong>Flight Price Prediction</strong>, <strong>Rainfall Prediction in Australia</strong>, and <strong>Banknote Authentication</strong>. These projects showcased my skills in data collection, analysis, and visualization using <strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong> and Python libraries. I developed web applications using micro web-frameworks like <strong>Flask</strong> and deployed them using <strong>Docker</strong> on cloud platforms such as <strong>Heroku</strong>, demonstrating comprehensive project lifecycle management."></p>

<br/>

<p class="type-it" data-text="Following my graduation, my passion for data and technology led me to join the <strong>AWS re/Start</strong> program through iPrimed, marking the beginning of my career journey. During this intensive 3-month training, I gained hands-on experience with a diverse range of tools and technologies including <strong>AWS, Linux, Networking, and server management</strong>. One of the highlights of the program was the opportunity to collaborate with professionals from various backgrounds, fostering teamwork and effective project delivery. The training structure mirrored real-world scenarios, combining rigorous classroom lectures with extensive lab sessions, totaling 8 hours daily. I leveraged AWS cloud services such as <strong>EC2</strong>, Amazon <strong>Athena</strong>, and <strong>RDS</strong> to work with datasets, gaining practical insights into cloud-based data management. As part of the program benefits, we received vouchers to obtain our <strong>AWS Cloud Practitioner</strong> certification, and numerous companies actively recruited from the cohort. I was selected at Cognizant as a Software Developer, contributing my skills and continuing to grow professionally."></p>

<p class="type-it" data-text="My journey into Web Development began during my internship at Cognizant, where I received training in the <strong>MVC</strong> framework. Using this knowledge, I developed a <strong>Todo List</strong> Web Application, marking a significant milestone in my career. I am currently honing my front-end skills with the goal of enhancing the aesthetics of my web-apps. In addition, I have crafted my own <strong>portfolio</strong> website to showcase my projects and newly acquired skills. Recently, I have developed my <strong>personal blog</strong> website using <strong>Node JS, Express JS and EJS templates</strong>. Feel free to explore my GitHub account for more details!"></p>

<p class="type-it" data-text="Beyond my professional interests, I enjoy gaming on my PS5 whenever time allows. My passion for video-games dates back to my childhood, starting with classic handhelds like Gameboy and PSP. I gravitate towards story-driven games with strong characterization and immersive world-building. Action-Adventure RPGs, especially the <strong>Souls series</strong>, hold a special place in my heart—<strong>Elden Ring</strong> has consumed countless hours of my time! Aside from gaming, I find solace in music, enjoying both Hindi and English songs. I maintain a healthy routine by taking evening walks and exercising regularly. Despite being in Gurgaon, I often find myself longing for more social connections. I plan to pursue higher studies abroad, which I hope will broaden my social circle and alleviate this sense of isolation.  While remote work offers efficiency and flexibility, it can sometimes impact one's social life. Nonetheless, I've shared a glimpse of myself, and if you've read this far, Thank You for your time!"></p>
